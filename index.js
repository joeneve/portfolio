    //you'll do kind of the quiz app, add a btn id tag to all of the buttons, 
    //then do a for loop to them, add event listener when you click on it, 
    //a function gets triggered with 2 parameters, current slide and desired slide, and do just like the opacity animations and you should be good to go
